  # Stable channel — populated by .github/workflows/release.yml on tag
  # push. Until v0.1.0 is cut, install with `brew install --HEAD`.
  # The release workflow uses mislav/bump-homebrew-formula-action to
  # rewrite `url` / `sha256` / `version` in the tap repo. The
  # `archive/refs/tags/<tag>.tar.gz` URL is the auto-generated source
  # tarball GitHub publishes for every tag; the bump action both
  # rewrites the URL prefix here and downloads it to compute sha256.
